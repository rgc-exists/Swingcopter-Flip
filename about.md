# Swingcopter Flip
A mod that flips the player's visuals upside down when gravity is reversed in swingcopter mode. Makes it easier to keep track of what your gravity is.

# DISCLAIMER
**Some people may consider this mod to be cheating due to the slight advantage it gives over vanilla!**  
If you're just playing for your own fun then this could be a good mod to use. Otherwise use with caution.

# "Flip Sprite When Right Side Up" Setting
**This is a setting that is on by default, because most swingcopter icons face up so it can feel confusing without it.**
*You can turn it off in the mod settings.*
